This repository contains the source material for [my website][site-url].

## Workflow

I build my website using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and deploy it via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

### Blog

I organise blog posts as [leaf bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) under `content/blog/`.
Some posts are written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
I convert such posts to Markdown using `R/build.R`.
