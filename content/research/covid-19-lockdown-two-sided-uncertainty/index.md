abstract: |
  When COVID-19 struck, the New Zealand government had two choices: enter lockdown immediately or delay its decision.
  Delay would have enabled more information to emerge about health and economic dynamics, while preserving the option to act at a later date.
  However, delay may have destroyed the option to eradicate COVID-19.
  We model the government's decision when faced with the uncertainty around health and economic dynamics generated by COVID-19.
  Our model captures both two-sided uncertainty and the dynamic consequences that flow from the government's initial decision.
  Our analysis will help guide future policy decisions amid similarly complex uncertainties.
