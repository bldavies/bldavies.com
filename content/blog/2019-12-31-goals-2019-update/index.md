title: "Goals for 2019: Update"
---

A year ago I [listed](/blog/goals-2019/) my three main goals for 2019:

> 1. Run a half marathon;
> 2. Read 12 books;
> 3. Publish five explorative blog posts.

I achieved the first and third, but failed the second.

I ran two half marathons: [one](https://www.strava.com/activities/2200007192) in the rain in March, and [another](https://www.strava.com/activities/2900367174) in the sun in November.
The next will be at [Round the Bays](https://wellingtonroundthebays.co.nz) in February 2020.

I read ten books:

* *Alex Through the Looking Glass* by Alex Bellos;
* *Humble Pi* by Matt Parker;
* *Money* by Yuval Noah Harari;
* *New Ideas from Dead Economists* by Todd G. Buchholtz;
* *On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft* by Stephen King;
* *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari;
* *The Code Book* by Simon Singh;
* *Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging* by Sebastian Junger;
* *Why Information Grows* by CÃ©sar Hidalgo;
* *21 Lessons for the 21st Century* by Yuval Noah Harari.

I read less than planned because I blogged more than planned.
I moved towards shorter, more focused posts, which gave me more time to develop and publish new ideas.
In the new year, I plan to look at [NBER working paper](/blog/introducing-nberwp/) co-authorships and to summarise my [Strava](http://localhost:1313/blog/accessing-strava-api/) activity data from 2019.
