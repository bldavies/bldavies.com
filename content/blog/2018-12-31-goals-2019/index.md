title: Goals for 2019
---

Christmas holidays provide valuable time to reflect and to set goals for the year ahead.
This year, I am publishing my goals online.
Doing so helps me set dynamically consistent goals by making a public commitment to my future self.
This commitment will keep me focused, honest and accountable.

I have three main goals for 2019:

1. Run a half marathon;
2. Read 12 books;
3. Publish five explorative blog posts.

These goals reflect my keen desire for personal growth.
I want to learn more about [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) and [pandoc](http://pandoc.org), and I plan to explore these tools in future posts.
