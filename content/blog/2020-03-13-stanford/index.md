I am excited to announce that I will be moving to the United States later this year to pursue a PhD in economics at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu).

[Stanford's economics PhD program](https://economics.stanford.edu/graduate/graduate-degree-programs/phd-degree) ranks among the best in the world.
It begins with two years of advanced coursework on microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and field courses relevant to my academic interests.
This coursework will strengthen my technical and research skills, and prepare me for writing a PhD thesis that contributes substantively to the economic research literature.

One topic that interests me is how people overcome uncertainty when forming teams.
For example, the students in my cohort face uncertainty about who among the Stanford faculty will be the best supervisor(s) for their eventual theses.
Likewise, faculty members face uncertainty about which students will be the best candidates to supervise.
Participating in lectures and seminars will help students and faculty estimate their match qualities, leading to more informed and productive matches.

Another topic that interests me is how people share information in networks.
For example, my blog posts on [information gerrymandering](/blog/information-gerrymandering/) and [DeGroot learning](/blog/degroot-learning-social-networks/) use mathematical models to analyse how inter-personal connections influence peoples' decisions and beliefs.
I am looking forward to learning more about these and related models, and their application to "real-world" social and economic systems.
