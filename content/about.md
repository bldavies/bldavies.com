title: About
---

I joined [Motu](https://motu.nz) in early 2018 after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury (UC).
My honours thesis analysed the relationship between insurance and savings as tools for hedging future income.
[I received the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) from the Motu Research and Education Foundation for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.

While at UC I was the teaching assistant for [micro-](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=ECON321&occurrence=17S1(C)&year=2017), [financial](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=FINC331&occurrence=17S1(C)&year=2017) and [quantitative economics](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=FIEC601&occurrence=17SU1(C)&year=2017).
I also interned within the actuarial consulting team at PwC, and completed a summer research project investigating whether independent risks should be insured together or separately.
The latter became a working paper that I presented at [the 44th EGRIE conference](http://www.egrie.org/annual-seminars?id=69) in London, UK.

At Motu, I work with [Dave Maré](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/dave-mare/) on a project that involves estimating the relatedness and complexity of economic activities using New Zealand census data.
Our work is funded through [Te Pūnaha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz), a Centre of Research Excellence focussed on networks and complex systems.
I also ran a [Deep South dialogue](https://www.deepsouthchallenge.co.nz/dialogues) on climate change adaptation within the transport sector.

I spend my leisure time reading, writing, playing guitar and staying fit.
