I'm a research analyst at [Motu](https://motu.nz), an economic and public policy research institute in Wellington, New Zealand.
I work with [Dave Maré](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/dave-mare/) on two projects that combine economics with network science:

1. estimating the relatedness and complexity of economic activities based on employee colocation patterns; and
2. identifying functional labour market areas based on community structures in commuter flow networks.

Both of these projects use New Zealand census microdata.
Our work is funded through [Te Pūnaha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz), a Centre of Research Excellence focused on networks and complex systems.

I joined Motu in 2018 after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury (UC).
My honours thesis analysed the relationship between insurance and savings as tools for hedging future income.
[I received the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.

While at UC I was a teaching assistant for undergraduate courses on [microeconomic theory](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=ECON321&occurrence=17S1(C)&year=2017) and [financial economics](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=FINC331&occurrence=17S1(C)&year=2017).
I also interned within the actuarial consulting team at PwC, and completed a summer research project investigating whether independent risks should be insured together or separately.
I presented [my working paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbt/econwp/17-05.html) on that project at [the 44th EGRIE conference](http://www.egrie.org/annual-seminars?id=69) in London, UK.

I spend my leisure time reading, writing, playing guitar and staying fit.
