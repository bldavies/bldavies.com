---

I'm a research analyst at [Motu](https://motu.nz), a non-profit economic  research institute in Wellington, New Zealand.
I work with [Dave Mar√©](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/dave-mare/) and [Adam Jaffe](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/adam-jaffe/) on a range of projects that combine economics with network science.
These projects include:

* estimating the relatedness and complexity of economic activities;
* identifying functional labour market areas from commuting flows;
* analysing the dynamics of research collaboration networks.

Outside of Motu, I work with [Mike Hoy](https://www.uoguelph.ca/lang/people/michael-hoy) and [Ray Rees](https://www.pe.econ.uni-muenchen.de/personen/ehemalige/rees/index.html) on a paper comparing public and private healthcare provision under optimal income taxation.

I hold a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics from the University of Canterbury.
My honours thesis analysed the relationship between insurance and savings as tools for hedging future income.
[I received the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.

I spend my leisure time reading, writing, playing guitar and staying fit.
