### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at [Stanford University](https://economics.stanford.edu), interested in how and why people interact.
I currently work with [Matthew Jackson](https://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/bio.html) on models and measures of [homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily).

I grew up in New Zealand, earning my BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics from the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz).
I won the [Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/capacity-building/scholarships/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.
I worked with [Adam Jaffe](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/people/adam-jaffe/) and [Dave Mar√©](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/people/dave-mare/) at [Motu](https://www.motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

I enjoy running, writing and playing music, and [blogging](/blog/) about my personal and research interests.
Some of my favorite blog posts include:

* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Computing epicycles](/blog/computing-epicycles/)
* [Policymaking under uncertainty](/blog/policymaking-under-uncertainty/)
