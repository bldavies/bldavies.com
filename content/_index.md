### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at Stanford University.
[My research](/research/) explores how people learn and interact.
It combines economic theory with tools from statistics and network science.

[My blog posts](/blog/) highlight some of my interests and quirks.
They include:

* simulating [bird elections](/blog/birds-voting-russian-interference/) and [gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/);
* analysing [transport](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/), [collaboration](/blog/female-representation-collaboration-nber/), and [co-habitation](/blog/habitat-choices-first-generation-pokemon/) networks;
* showing, mathematically, how to [run fast races](/blog/optimal-pacing-varying-energy-costs/) and [make animations](/blog/computing-epicycles);
* summarising papers on [research incentives](/blog/research-incentives-evolution-knowledge/) and [science communication](/blog/communicating-science/);
* describing my experience [applying to PhD programs](/blog/applying-economics-phd-programs/) and [living in the USA](blog/living-america/).
