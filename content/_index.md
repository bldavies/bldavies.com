### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at Stanford University.
My [research](/research/) explores how people learn, interact, and form connections.
I lived and worked in New Zealand before starting my PhD.

Outside of research I love to run, cook, and [blog](/blog/).
My favorite blog posts include:

* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Birds, voting, and Russian interference](/blog/birds-voting-russian-interference/)
* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [Rationalizing negative splits](/blog/rationalizing-negative-splits/)
* [Truth-seekers and ideologues](/blog/truth-seekers-ideologues/)

I've also written about [applying to economics PhD programs](/blog/applying-economics-phd-programs/) and [living in the USA](blog/living-america/).

See [my CV](/cv.pdf) or [send me an email](mailto:bldavies@stanford.edu) for more information.
