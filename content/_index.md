### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at [Stanford University](https://economics.stanford.edu), interested in theoretical and empirical models of how people interact.

I grew up in New Zealand, earning my BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics from the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz).
I worked as a research analyst at [Motu](https://motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

I enjoy running, playing guitar, and [blogging](/blog/) about methods and ideas I find interesting.
Some of my favorite blog posts include:

* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Computing epicycles](/blog/computing-epicycles/)
* [Policymaking under uncertainty](/blog/policymaking-under-uncertainty/)

See [my CV](/cv.pdf) or [get in touch](mailto:bldavies@stanford.edu) for more information.
