### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at [Stanford University](https://economics.stanford.edu).
I'm interested in networks, uncertainty, and the division of cognitive labor.
Before starting my PhD I lived in New Zealand, where I worked as a research analyst at [Motu](https://www.motu.nz).

Outside of research I enjoy running, live music, and blogging.
Some of my favorite blog posts are on [Christmas games](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/), [math-driven animations](/blog/computing-epicycles/), and [the NYC subway network](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/).
I have also written about [applying to economics PhD programs](/blog/applying-economics-phd-programs/).

See [my CV](/cv.pdf) or [get in touch](mailto:bldavies@stanford.edu) for more information.
