### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at Stanford University.
My research interests span social, financial, labour, and innovation economics.

I grew up in New Zealand, earning my BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics from the University of Canterbury.
I worked at [Motu](https://motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

I discuss my research and personal projects on [my blog](/blog).
Some of my favourite blog posts include:

* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Computing epicycles](/blog/computing-epicycles/)
* [Information gerrymandering](/blog/information-gerrymandering/)

I spend the rest of my leisure time running, cycling, and playing guitar.
