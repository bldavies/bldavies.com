### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at Stanford University.
I'm interested in how people make decisions, combine skills, share ideas, and form teams.

I grew up in New Zealand, and earned a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics from the University of Canterbury.
[I won the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.
I worked at [Motu](https://motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

I [blog](/blog/) about my personal and research interests.
Some of my favorite blog posts include:

* [White Elephant Gift Exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How Central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Information Gerrymandering](/blog/information-gerrymandering/)

I spend the rest of my leisure time running and playing guitar.
