### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm a research analyst at [Motu](https://motu.nz), an economic research institute in Wellington, New Zealand.
At Motu I work with [Adam Jaffe](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/adam-jaffe/) and [Dave Mar√©](https://motu.nz/about-us/people/dave-mare/) on a range of projects that combine economics with network science.

I joined Motu after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury.
[I won the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.

I enjoy writing as a self-learning mechanism, and maintain a [blog](/blog/) on personal, technical and research interests.
Some of my favorite blog posts include:

* [White  Elephant Gift Exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How Central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Information Gerrymandering](/blog/information-gerrymandering/)
