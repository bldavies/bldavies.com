### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at [Stanford University](https://economics.stanford.edu), interested in theoretical and empirical models of how people interact.

Before starting my PhD I was a research analyst at [Motu](https://motu.nz), where I worked with [Adam Jaffe](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/people/adam-jaffe/) and [Dave Mar√©](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/people/dave-mare/) on a range of projects combining economics with network science.
I joined Motu after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury.

I enjoy running, playing guitar, and [blogging](/blog/) about methods and ideas I find interesting.
Some of my favorite blog posts include:

* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Computing epicycles](/blog/computing-epicycles/)
* [Information gerrymandering](/blog/information-gerrymandering/)
