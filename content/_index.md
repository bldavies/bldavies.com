### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm a PhD candidate at Stanford University, where I study economic theory and behavioral economics.
[My research](/research) explores the role that conceptual knowledge plays in human learning and decision-making.
I'm also interested in how people collaborate, communicate, and cope with uncertainty.

You can view my CV [here](/cv.pdf) and contact me at bldavies@stanford.edu.
