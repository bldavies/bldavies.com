## About me

I'm a research analyst at [Motu](https://motu.nz), an economic research institute in Wellington, New Zealand.
I joined Motu after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury.
[I won the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.
