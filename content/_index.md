### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at [Stanford University](https://economics.stanford.edu).
I'm interested in networks, decision-making, and the supply and demand of evidence.

I grew up in New Zealand, where I earned a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics.
I worked at [Motu](https://www.motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

Outside of research I enjoy running, playing music, and [blogging](/blog/).

See [my CV](/cv.pdf) or [get in touch](mailto:bldavies@stanford.edu) for more information.
