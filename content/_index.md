### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at [Stanford University](https://economics.stanford.edu).
I'm interested in networks, experts, uncertainty, and metascience.
I lived in New Zealand and worked at [Motu](https://www.motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

Outside of research I enjoy running, playing music, and [blogging](/blog/).
My favorite blog posts include:

* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Birds, voting, and Russian interference](/blog/birds-voting-russian-interference/)
* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [Rationalizing negative splits](/blog/rationalizing-negative-splits/)
* [Truth-seekers and ideologues](/blog/truth-seekers-ideologues/)

I've also written about [applying to economics PhD programs](/blog/applying-economics-phd-programs/) and [living in the USA](blog/living-america/).

See [my CV](/cv.pdf) for more information.
