### Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm an economics PhD student at Stanford University.
My research interests span social, financial, labour, and innovation economics.

I studied undergraduate economics and mathematics in New Zealand, and [won the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.
I worked at [Motu](https://motu.nz) before starting my PhD.

I [blog](/blog/) about my personal and research interests.
Some highlights include:

* [Applying to economics PhD programs](/blog/applying-economics-phd-programs/)

* [White elephant gift exchanges](/blog/white-elephant-gift-exchanges/)
* [How central is Grand Central Terminal?](/blog/how-central-grand-central-terminal/)
* [Information gerrymandering](/blog/information-gerrymandering/)

I spend the rest of my leisure time running and playing guitar.
