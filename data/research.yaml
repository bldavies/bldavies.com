    We analyse whether research funding contests promote co-authorship.
    Our analysis combines Scopus publication records with data on applications to the Marsden Fund, the premiere source of funding for basic research in New Zealand.
    On average, and after controlling for observable and unobservable heterogeneity, applicant pairs were 13.8 percentage points more likely to co-author in a given year if they co-proposed during the previous ten years than if they did not.
    This co-authorship rate was not significantly higher among funded pairs.
    However, when we increase post-proposal publication lags towards the length of a typical award, we find that funding, rather than participation, promotes co-authorship.

    We describe an unsupervised method for delineating functional labour market areas (LMAs) in national commuting networks.
    Our method uses the Louvain algorithm, which we extend to support top-down hierarchical LMA classification and estimable classification stabilities.
    We demonstrate our method using historical Census commuting data from New Zealand.

    When COVID-19 struck, the New Zealand government had two choices: enter lockdown immediately or delay its decision.
    Delay would have enabled more information to emerge about health and economic dynamics, while preserving the option to act at a later date.
    However, delay may have destroyed the option to eradicate COVID-19.
    We model the government’s decision when faced with the uncertainty around health and economic dynamics generated by COVID-19.
    Our model captures both two-sided uncertainty and the dynamic consequences that flow from the government’s initial decision.
    Our analysis will help guide future policy decisions amid similarly complex uncertainties.

    We derive a measure of the relatedness between economic activities based on weighted correlations of local employment shares.
    Our approach recognizes variation in the extent of local specialization and adjusts for differences in data quality between cities.
    We use our measure to estimate activity and city complexity, and examine the contribution of relatedness and complexity to urban employment growth in New Zealand.
    Relatedness and complexity are complementary in promoting employment growth in New Zealand’s largest cities, but do not contribute to employment growth in its smaller cities.

    Risky prospects can often by disaggregated into several identifiable, smaller risks.
    In such cases, at least two modes of insurance are available: either (i) the disaggregated risks can be insured independently or (ii) the aggregate risk can be insured as one.
    We identify (ii) as risk bundling prior to insurance and (i) as separate, or unbundled, insurance.
    We investigate whether (i) or (ii) is preferable among consumers, insurers and the insurance market as a whole using numerical simulations.
    Our simulations reveal that separate contracts provide the socially optimal form of insurance when the insurer is able to charge the profit-maximising premia and has perfect information.
    Under asymmetric information with respect to consumers’ risk aversion, we find that separation is again the dominant method of insurance in terms of the market share it represents.
